<p align="center">A mouse support mod for HoloCure!</p>

# About

MouseSupport is a mod for Holocure that adds mouse support to most of the interactable menus, and mouse aiming.

Using the mouse makes navigating around menus much simpler, and mouse aim provides an easier and a fresher way to aim!


**:warning:Disclaimer: If your version of HoloCure is newer than the mods, the game *will revert to an older version of the game.***
## Demo

## Features :sparkles:

- Mouse support on all menus that the keyboard can interact with!
- MouseAim for people who want to aim with just their mouse, Toggle it by pressing left click  (Now inspired from Kay-Yu teaser)
  - Note:memo:: You can't aim or Toggle MouseAim while standing still

### MouseAim Demo:

# Installation :package:

2. Download The most recent zip with your chosen HUD type
3. Extract and open your newly downloaded zip
5. Inside the newly extracted zip should contain a data.win file. Copy it
6. Find your Holocure installation location and replace your data.win file

You can now play HoloCure with Mouse Support! :tada:

## Updating the mod :arrow_up:
  1. Download the newest zip
  2. Select a HUD Type
  3. Copy the data.win file in the zip
  4. Replace the data.win in your HoloCure Installation location
  
## Uninstalling :wastebasket:
  1. In your HoloCure Install location, check that you have the "data.win.bck"
