# About

MouseSupport is a mod for Holocure that adds mouse support to most of the interactable menus, and mouse aiming.

Using the mouse makes navigating around menus much simpler, and mouse aim provides an easier and a fresher way to aim!

**:warning:Disclaimer: If your version of HoloCure is newer than the mods, the game *will revert to an older version of the game.***

## Features :sparkles:

- Mouse support on all menus that the keyboard can interact with!
- MouseAim for people who want to aim with just their mouse
  - Note:memo:: You can't aim while standing still
- 3 different in-game cursor styles
  - Default Cursor
